# Getting started

Let's start our journey with Bastion. During it we will see the main features, we have a lot to discover. For that we will follow a theme, we will build a small CRUD application.

In this first chapter, we will talking about:
- Installing Bastion on your project
- Classic and timeless: hello, world!

Don't forget, if you have any question, you can find us on [Discord][]!

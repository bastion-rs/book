# How to

In this section we will talk about the principal features of bastion, with a functional approach.

The examples are just illustrating the purpose explained in the current section, not more, not less. We will complexify them during the book by adding new notions. If you need to have complete use cases you can find them in the [example section][Example section] of the bastion repository.
